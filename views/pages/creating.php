<p>This started out as one simple experiment in their 2D engine, and it branched off in two directions.  </p>
<p>
The first one randomizes the map every time, and has a simple win condition of collecting the coins..
</p>

<p>The second one takes that idea but moves it to a Zelda style, non random map with four different scenes you can move to.</p>

<a href="games/pa/PixelAdventure.html">Pixel Adventure</a>



<p>Both are playable in modern browsers, but I am aware there is no real level design or enjoyable "game" in them, more of a test project.  
They both need tons of work eventually, unless I just move to something else all together.  They have been on hold for a while as I built this website and 
my Minecraft mods.</p>
