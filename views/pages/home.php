    Welcome to my home page, where I talk about programming, mostly about games and mods that I have made.
</h3>
       

<p>
    I have eleven Minecraft mods out for Minecraft Forge 1.7.2, and I have been toying with some javascript 
    game libraries and some other tools.

<p>I am working on a blog system to post updates here, as well as a database for some of the things I am collectiing, but for now this landing page 
is pretty empty.  All the cool stuff is on the other three tabs.</p>
