<h3>
    Welcome to my blog, where I talk about programming, mostly about games and mods that I have made.
</h3>
 
 <p>
     Eventually I plan to put out more frequent articles, with topics and tag lines.  For now I just have one post about some random minecraft screenshots 
     that I found.

    I have eleven Minecraft mods out for Minecraft Forge 1.7.2, and I have been toying with some javascript 
    game libraries and some other tools.

<br/>
<p>I am working on a blog system to post updates here, as well as a database for some of the things I am collectiing, but for now this landing page 
is pretty empty.  All the cool stuff is on the other three tabs.</p>

To fill this empty space, here is an album of images I uploaded way back in December 2011.  Back when I played on an old reddit minecraft 
server  (<a href="mcpublic.reddit.com">here</a> and formerly <a href="pvelothos.reddit.com">here</a>).
