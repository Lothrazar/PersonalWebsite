    <h3>Custom Arcade</h3>
    
    This is about the arcade software on my github page.

    The idea was to have one consolidated place to play all emulated games (ROMS).  I own and collect all sorts of real game cartridges, but sometimes it is 
    just easier to play it emulated.  I wanted to have one custom interface for all emulated games regardless if it was for Nintedo, Sega, or anything else.

    More information coming soon, this is still under construction.
